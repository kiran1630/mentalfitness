- ## Data Source 2:
      - Data on the prevalence of various mental and substance use disorders.


# Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing for improved data quality.

- Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.

- Visualization of data trends and patterns using scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and potentially maps.

- Geographical variations in mental health burden.

- Impact of substance use on mental health.

This project uses Python for data analysis and visualization.
